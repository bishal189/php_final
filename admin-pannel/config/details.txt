config 
1.config.php
   Three functions are made ie root , base and exit.
   a.root 
     path parameter is given in root which removes any slashes from the start and end of $path and then uses __FILE__ to get the current file's path. 
     The root() function in this PHP code is used to generate the absolute file path to the root directory of the web application. 

   b.base_url
     returns the resulting URL.
      
   c. exit_url
     similar to base_url(), but it returns a URL for a different part of the web application.
     It concatenates these values with digital-assignment/ and $path to form the complete URL. Finally, it returns the resulting URL.   

The root() function returns the absolute file path to the root directory of the application. 
It is useful for ensuring that file path references within the application are consistent and accurate.

The base_url() function returns a URL for a specified path within the "admin-pannel" directory of the application. 
It is useful for generating links to pages within the admin panel of the application.

The exit_url() function returns a URL for a specified path within the main directory of the application.
It is useful for generating links to pages outside of the admin panel, such as the homepage of the application.

2.db.php
pdo= php data objects (extension that provides a consistent interface for accessing databases in PHP)
